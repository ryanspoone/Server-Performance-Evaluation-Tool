# Future Development Goals

SPET has some long term goals in mind, goals that will take slow and
continuous effort to achieve.

## Virtual Machine (VM) Performance Test

This performance test was one of the first ones we wanted to create. Due
to time constraints, this has been put on the back burner.

Additional Result File Types --------------------------

CSV, XSLX, PDF, and HTML would give SPET more accessibility.

## Better Progress/Running Indication

For non-verbose runs, it's hard to tell what SPET is currently doing,
especially on long performance tests like LINPACK. An indicator such as
a spinner would allow users to see that it is currently still running.

## Additional Automated Testing/Validation

Before release, the tests were outdated so they were removed. Adding new
tests would allow future developers to easily diagnose programmatic
errors. In addition, further validation of performance tests are always
a plus.

## Add Documentation For Each Performance Test

To help newcomers to the performance testing world.
